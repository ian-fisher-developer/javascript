# Learning About JavaScript

Much of my professional experience is with C++/Qt rich-client desktop applications.

These are my personal investigations of JavaScript and related web-oriented technologies, learning by hand-crafting small, tested applications.


## Exercises

This is a brief summary of the exercises. Click the links above for more information. For example, link 1_hello_world has all details for the first exercise.

1. Hello World

   The typical starter application, useful for discovering configuration details.


## Configuration

The first exercises are simple. The goal is to run in any modern browser with no significant system installs.

Many tutorials start gently by opening code from your local file system in a browser. That's nice, but here the very first exercise introduces JavaScript modules, an essential code organization technique. Modules do not work directly from the local file system. They require a server.

Happily, many IDEs provide assistance. For example, if you use VSCode, install the Live Server extension, then right-click in the HTML editor and select the "Open with Live Server" item.

That should be enough to get started developing many lines of well-tested code.
